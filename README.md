## Installation

### AMD, Node.js, CommonJS

```

## Usage

### Basic, with optional settings

```

Sides can be passed as unique string with spaces

```js
var options = {sides: "top right left bottom"}
```

var bar = document.getElementById("bar");
viewportUtils.inViewport(elem, {container: bar});

viewportUtils.inViewport(elem, {top: 12, right: 12});

viewportUtils.inViewportTop(elem);
```

These will check for the matching side, with default settings
